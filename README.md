# Project-02
Responsive Photography Portfolio Website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

- NOTE FOR MY SELF -

- By the conclusion of this project, I will possess the expertise to design sophisticated and fully responsive websites. Delving into the intricacies of "CSS Media Queries" and utilizing versatile "CSS Units" such as rem, %, vh, and vw, I will ensure a visually appealing 
   and adaptable design across all devices. 

- Elevating the aesthetic further, I'll incorporate "CSS Transitions and CSS Keyframes" for engaging animations, cultivating a modern and dynamic website vibe.

- To refine the layout, I'll harness the power of "CSS Flexbox" for seamless alignment and introduce the formidable "CSS Grid System" as a strategic tool for effortless element arrangement. Adding a layer of customization, "CSS Variables" will be employed for streamlined 
   adjustments and design personalization. 

- As a finishing touch, the inclusion of the "Swiper.JS" library will infuse sleek slides for a polished and professional user experience. In essence, this journey will equip me to craft websites that not only boast a contemporary aesthetic but also boast unparalleled   
   responsiveness and dynamic functionality.
