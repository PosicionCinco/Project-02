# Project-02
Responsive Photography Portfolio Website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

<! -- NOTE FOR MY SELF -- >

Alright, so by the end of this project, I'm gonna know how to design a slick, fully responsive website. We're diving into the world of "CSS Media Queries" and mixing it up with some nifty "CSS Units" like rem, %, vh, and vw to make sure our design looks good on any device. And hey, we're not stopping there - we're spicing things up with "CSS Transitions and CSS Keyframes" for some cool animations.

I'm aiming for a modern website vibe, and to help with the layout, we're getting cozy with "CSS Flexbox." But wait, there's more! The "CSS Grid System" is gonna be our secret weapon for effortlessly aligning elements. Oh, and did I mention the magic of "CSS Variables" for easy customization? It's like having a secret toolkit.

And for that extra touch, we're bringing in the big guns â€“ "Swiper.JS" library is joining the party for those sleek slides. So, buckle up, by the end of this, I'll be a pro at crafting websites that not only look good but are also super responsive and dynamic.
